  amount: "",            // ← PRESERVED
}
```

## 📋 **VALIDATION FEATURES ADDED**

### **1. Required Field Validation**
```javascript
// Example: Budget Head validation
if (!formData.budgetHead) {
  errors.budgetHead = "Budget Head is required";
}
```

### **2. Business Rule Validation**  
```javascript
// Example: Amount vs Balance validation (preserved exact logic)
if (parseFloat(formData.amount) > parseFloat(balanceAmount)) {
  errors.amount = `Amount cannot exceed balance amount: ${balanceAmount}`;
}
```

### **3. Real-time Error Clearing**
```javascript
// Errors clear when user starts typing
const handleChange = (e) => {
  // ... preserve original logic ...
  
  // Clear error when user fixes the field
  if (formErrors[name]) {
    setFormErrors(prev => ({ ...prev, [name]: "" }));
  }
};
```

### **4. Loading States**
```javascript
// Prevent double submissions
<button 
  type="submit" 
  disabled={isSubmitting}
>
  {isSubmitting ? 'Saving...' : 'Save'}
</button>
```

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Update App.js routing** to use new Finance forms
2. **Test forms** in development environment  
3. **Deploy incrementally** - one form at a time
4. **User acceptance testing** by Finance department
5. **Remove old forms** after verification
