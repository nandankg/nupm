## üèóÔ∏è **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Universal Components by Department**

#### **Telecom Universal Components**:
```javascript
// UniversalTelecomFormField.jsx - Telecom-specific fields
- System identifiers (TER, UPS, CSS, etc.)
- PM frequency selectors (Monthly, Quarterly, Half-yearly, Yearly)
- Technical parameters (voltage, temperature, system status)
- Location selectors (Depot, Station, OCC, BCC)
- Maintenance activity checklists

// TelecomFormLayout.jsx - Telecom form layouts
- Consistent telecom branding and structure
- PM maintenance workflow layouts
- Technical parameter input layouts
```

#### **AFC Universal Components**:
```javascript
// UniversalAFCFormField.jsx - AFC-specific fields  
- AFC equipment types (TVM, TOM, Gate, SDC, RCTM, AVM)
- Card management fields (CSC, Agent cards, URC)
- AFC system parameters
- Maintenance schedules (specific to AFC frequencies)

// AFCFormLayout.jsx - AFC form layouts
- AFC-specific workflow layouts
- Equipment maintenance patterns
- Transaction record layouts
```

### **Component Reuse Strategy**:
1. **Telecom**: Create new universal components (technical focus)
2. **AFC-Mainline**: Create AFC universal components (equipment focus) 
3. **AFC-SDC**: Reuse 80% of AFC-Mainline components
4. **AFC-Store**: Reuse 90% of existing administrative components

---

## üìã **FIELD PRESERVATION METHODOLOGY**

### **Research Phase for Each Department**:
1. **Locate Existing Forms** in developer-based folders:
   ```bash
   find src/forms -name "*telecom*" -o -name "*afc*" -o -name "*pm*"
   find src/forms -name "*daily*" -o -name "*checklist*" -o -name "*logbook*"
   ```

2. **Extract Field Structures** from each located form
3. **Document Dropdown Options** and validation rules
4. **Preserve Business Logic** exactly as implemented
5. **Map API Endpoints** and Redux integration points

### **Quality Assurance Standards**:
- ‚úÖ **100% Field Name Preservation** (never change existing names)
- ‚úÖ **100% Dropdown Option Preservation** (exact same options)
- ‚úÖ **100% Business Logic Preservation** (same validation rules)
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Validation** added without changing core behavior
- ‚úÖ **Universal Component Integration** for performance gains

## üìä **SUCCESS METRICS & KPIs**

### **Quality Metrics (per Department)**:
- **Field Preservation Rate**: Target 100%
- **Validation Coverage**: Target 100% of forms
- **Performance Improvement**: Target 60-70% code reduction  
- **Error Reduction**: Target 80% fewer form submission errors

## üîÑ **RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION**

### **High Risk Areas**:

#### **1. Telecom Complexity Risk**
- **Risk**: 33 forms with complex PM schedules and technical parameters
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Start with daily operations (simpler forms)
  - Create robust universal components early
  - Allocate extra time (15 days vs typical 10-12)

#### **2. AFC Integration Risk** 
- **Risk**: AFC-Mainline and AFC-SDC have interdependencies
- **Mitigation**:
  - Complete AFC-Mainline first to establish patterns
  - Reuse 80%+ components for AFC-SDC
  - Plan for unified AFC component library

#### **3. Timeline Pressure Risk**
- **Risk**: 37 days is aggressive for 76 forms
- **Mitigation**:
  - Built-in buffer days (weekends not counted)
  - Proven methodology reduces uncertainty
  - Component reuse accelerates later phases

### **Medium Risk Areas**:

#### **4. Field Discovery Risk**
- **Risk**: Some forms may be harder to locate in developer folders
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive search strategy prepared
  - Multiple search patterns for each department
  - Fallback to create from scratch if needed

#### **5. Technical Debt Risk**
- **Risk**: Rush to complete may compromise code quality
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strict quality gates at each phase
  - No compromises on field preservation
  - User acceptance required for each department
