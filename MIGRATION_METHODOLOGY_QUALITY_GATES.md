## 🔍 **FIELD PRESERVATION METHODOLOGY**

### **The "Golden Rule": Never Change Existing Fields**

#### **Field Discovery Process**:
1. **Locate Original Form**:
   ```bash
   find src/forms -name "*{form-identifier}*"
   grep -r "{form-name}" src/forms/
   ```

2. **Extract Field Structure**:
   ```javascript
   // Document EXACT field names as they appear
   const originalFields = {
     fieldName1: "",           // ✅ EXACT name
     field_name_2: "",         // ✅ EXACT name with underscore
     fieldNameThree: "",       // ✅ EXACT camelCase
     "field-name-four": "",    // ✅ EXACT with hyphens
   };
   ```

3. **Preserve Dropdown Options**:
   ```javascript
   // Document EXACT options as they appear
   const dropdownOptions = [
     "Option 1",               // ✅ EXACT text
     "option_2",              // ✅ EXACT case
     "OPTION-THREE",          // ✅ EXACT format
   ];
   ```

4. **Preserve Business Logic**:
   ```javascript
   // Document EXACT validation rules
   const businessRules = {
     required: ["field1", "field2"],
     dateValidation: "field3 > field4",
     customLogic: "if (field1 === 'value') then field2 required"
   };
   ```

#### **Implementation Standards**:
- **NEVER** change field names, even if they contain typos
- **NEVER** change dropdown option text or values
- **NEVER** modify existing validation logic
- **ALWAYS** add enhanced validation as additional layer
- **ALWAYS** preserve API request/response structure
