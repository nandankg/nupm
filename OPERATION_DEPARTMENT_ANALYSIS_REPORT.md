## üîß **TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**

### **Common Field Patterns Expected:**
Based on form names and railway operations, likely fields:
- **Date/Time fields** - Most forms will have date/time entries
- **Equipment IDs** - Equipment-related forms need equipment identification
- **Employee fields** - Staff ID, name, designation for most forms
- **Location fields** - Station, section, kilometer posts
- **Description fields** - Detailed incident/maintenance descriptions
- **Status fields** - Active, completed, pending status tracking
- **Reference numbers** - Unique identifiers for tracking

### **Validation Requirements:**
- **Date validation** - Proper date formats and ranges
- **Employee ID validation** - Valid employee identification
- **Equipment ID validation** - Valid equipment codes
- **Mandatory field validation** - Critical fields must be filled
- **Business rule validation** - Department-specific rules

### **Performance Considerations:**
- **Heavy forms** - Equipment registers may have many fields
- **Frequent usage** - Daily operations forms need optimization
- **Data volume** - Some forms may handle large datasets
- **Real-time requirements** - Safety forms may need immediate processing

---

## üéØ **UNIVERSAL COMPONENTS NEEDED**

### **Operation-Specific Components:**
1. **OperationFormField** - Handles operation-specific field types
2. **EmployeeSelector** - Employee selection with validation
3. **EquipmentSelector** - Equipment identification component
4. **LocationSelector** - Station/section selection
5. **DateTimeField** - Railway-specific date/time handling
6. **StatusTracker** - Status management component
7. **OperationFormLayout** - Consistent layout for all operation forms

### **Shared Components with Finance:**
- Universal validation system
- Error handling components
- Loading state management
- Form submission handling

---

## üìã **FIELD PRESERVATION STRATEGY**

### **Research Approach:**
1. **Identify existing forms** in codebase (developer folders)
2. **Extract exact field structures** from each form
3. **Preserve field names 100%** - No changes to existing names
4. **Preserve dropdown options** - Exact same options
5. **Preserve business logic** - Same validation rules
6. **Preserve API calls** - Same endpoints and data structure

### **Documentation Requirements:**
For each form:
- **Field inventory** - Complete list of all fields
- **Dropdown options** - All options documented
- **Validation rules** - Existing business rules
- **API endpoints** - Current integration points
- **User workflow** - How department uses the form

---

## üîç **EXISTING CODEBASE ANALYSIS**

### **Expected Locations:**
Operation forms likely scattered across developer folders:
- `src/forms/akshra/` - May contain operation forms
- `src/forms/chanchal/` - May contain operation forms
- `src/forms/isha/` - May contain operation forms
- `src/forms/manshi/` - May contain operation forms
- `src/forms/monika/` - May contain operation forms
- `src/forms/pinki/` - May contain operation forms
- `src/forms/rajiv/` - May contain operation forms
- `src/forms/satya/` - May contain operation forms
- `src/forms/store/` - May contain operation forms

### **Search Strategy:**
Use form slugs and names to locate existing implementations:
```bash
# Search for equipment failure forms
find src/ -name "*Equipment*" -o -name "*equipment*" -o -name "*failure*"

# Search for incident forms  
find src/ -name "*Incident*" -o -name "*incident*" -o -name "*accident*"

# Search for crew control forms
find src/ -name "*Crew*" -o -name "*crew*" -o -name "*attendance*"
```
